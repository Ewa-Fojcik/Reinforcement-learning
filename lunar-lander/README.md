# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Lunar Lander

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent designed to master the `LunarLander-v2` environment from the Gymnasium library (formerly OpenAI Gym). The project demonstrates the application of DRL principles to solve a classic control problem, showcasing the agent's learning progress and performance in a physics-based simulation.

## Problem Statement

The Lunar Lander environment challenges an agent to land a spacecraft safely between two flags on a landing pad, with limited fuel and under the influence of gravity. The agent must learn to control its main engine and side thrusters to achieve a soft landing without crashing or running out of fuel. This continuous control task serves as an excellent benchmark for evaluating DRL algorithms.
